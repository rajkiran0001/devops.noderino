# Noderino Fun App!

This is a node app with a bunch of environment variables you can customize to learn!

- `DESIRED_PATH` - changes the path that the server listens to. 
- `PORT` - changes the port that the server listens to.
- `NUMBER` - changes an arbitrary number that is given to the server.

If you're running this app on a debian linux server (like ubuntu), don't forget to:
1. Install node:
`sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs -y && sudo apt install npm -y`
2. Install dependencies:
`npm install`
3. Run the server:
`node server.js`

Have fun! :rocket:
